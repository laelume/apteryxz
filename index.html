    <h1><b>APTERYX(Z)!!</b><p>
	<i>International Livecoding Collective</i></h1>
    <b><i>Apteryxz</b></i> is a group of livecoding artists, spontaneously organized due to common interest in algorithmic musical composition!<p>
    We use <a href="https://github.com/qirky/foxdot">FoxDot</a> and <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider">SuperCollider</a> to make music, and use the networked collaboration tool <a href="https://github.com/qirky/troop">Troop</a> to collaborate in real-time.<p>
    We are a <u>[dis!]</u>organized international collective of people with different tastes and preferences. Our music can be chaotic, happy, sad, deep, trippy, or simply crazy! We like to <sup>build</sup> things, <sub>break</sub> them, and test the <big> _ l _ i _ m _ i _ t _ s _ </big> of possibility with out harware and our brains! Our collaborative jam sessions are created on-the-fly, with little to no previous plan, and are completely improvised.<p>
    Tune in to <a href="https://t.me/foxdot">our group chat</a> to learn more!!!
